# SQL-for-Data-Scientist
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for data science and working with relational databases. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently. 
Common SQL queries and operations used in data science

1. Retrieving Data:
   - SELECT: Fetch data from one or more tables.
   - FROM: Specify the table(s) to retrieve data from.
   - WHERE: Apply conditions to filter the data based on specific criteria.
   - GROUP BY: Group the data based on one or more columns.
   - HAVING: Apply conditions to filter grouped data.
   - ORDER BY: Sort the result set based on one or more columns.
   - LIMIT: Limit the number of rows returned in the result set.

2. Joins:
   - INNER JOIN: Retrieve records that have matching values in both tables.
   - LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
   - RIGHT JOIN: Retrieve all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
   - FULL JOIN: Retrieve all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
   - CROSS JOIN: Generate all possible combinations of records from both tables.

3. Aggregations and Calculations:
   - COUNT: Count the number of rows or non-null values.
   - SUM: Calculate the sum of a numeric column.
   - AVG: Calculate the average of a numeric column.
   - MIN: Find the minimum value in a column.
   - MAX: Find the maximum value in a column.
   - GROUP BY: Group the data and perform aggregations within each group.
   - DISTINCT: Retrieve unique values from a column.

4. Filtering and Conditional Logic:
   - WHERE: Apply conditions to filter rows based on specific criteria.
   - AND, OR, NOT: Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
   - IN: Check if a value matches any value in a list.
   - BETWEEN: Check if a value is within a range.
   - LIKE: Match patterns using wildcards (% and _).
   - CASE WHEN: Perform conditional logic to derive new values.

5. Subqueries:
   - Subqueries are queries embedded within another query.
   - They can be used for complex filtering, calculations, and joining operations.

6. Data Manipulation:
   - INSERT INTO: Insert new records into a table.
   - UPDATE: Modify existing records in a table.
   - DELETE FROM: Remove records from a table.

7. Data Transformation:
   - CAST/CONVERT: Convert data types.
   - CONCAT: Concatenate strings.
   - DATE functions: Manipulate dates and times.
   - Mathematical functions: Perform calculations on numeric data.
   - String functions: Manipulate and analyze text data.
   - Aggregate functions: Perform calculations on groups of rows.
